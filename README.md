# SQL-Project: Query a Digital Music Store Database

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a digital music store's database to extract valuable insights using SQL queries. The database used is the **Chinook Database**, a sample database that simulates a digital music store. The analysis focuses on answering key business-related questions regarding sales, customers, and music trends.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the **Chinook Database (chinook.db)**, which contains tables such as:
- **Customers**: Information about customers
- **Invoices**: Purchase records of customers
- **InvoiceLines**: Details of each purchased track
- **Tracks**: Information about songs available in the store
- **Artists**: Details about music artists
- **Albums**: Information on albums and their respective artists
- **Genres**: Categorization of music tracks
- **Employees**: Store staff details
- **Playlists**: Predefined playlists with associated tracks

## Files in the Repository
- `chinook.db`: The SQLite database file used for analysis.
- `SQL Queries.txt`: A collection of SQL queries executed on the database to extract insights.
- `Question 1.csv`, `Question 2.csv`, `Question 3.csv`, `Question 4.csv`: CSV files containing the results of the executed SQL queries.
- `Questions and Visualization.pdf`: A document presenting the analysis results with visualizations and explanations.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Analysis and Key Questions
The analysis addresses the following business questions:
1. **Which genre has the most and least track sales?**
   - Most sold: Rock (1297 sales)
   - Least sold: Opera (1 sale)

2. **What is the most popular genre in the USA?**
   - Answer: Rock (157 purchases)

3. **Which artist has produced the most tracks in the Rock genre?**
   - Answer: Led Zeppelin (114 tracks)

4. **Which customer has spent the most on music, and from which country?**
   - Answer: Helena Hol√Ω (Czech Republic, $49.62)

## Tools Used
- **SQLite** for querying the database
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** for data analysis and visualization (if applicable)
- **Excel/Google Sheets** for tabular data representation

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Analyze-Digital-Music-Store-Database.git
   ```
2. Open `chinook.db` using an SQLite viewer or execute the queries in `SQL Queries.txt`.
3. Review the CSV files for extracted insights.
4. Refer to `Questions and Visualization.pdf` for analysis interpretations and visual representations.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to analyze a digital music store's database effectively. The insights derived can help businesses optimize their sales strategies, understand customer preferences, and improve inventory management.
